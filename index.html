<div class="deep">
  <p>Chicago style pizza<span class="price">$23</span><br />
  <small>Chicago style is a filler pizza. Meaning you will only be able to eat one slice. Although you might want to eat more it is not recommended. Please do not test our theory. There are no prizes if you eat two and no refunds either. </small></p>
</div>

<div class="orignal">
  <p>Plain Jane pizza<span class="price">$15</span><br />
  <small>Are you basic? Nothing special, this pizza is for you. The Plain Jane is just sauce cheese and toppings of your choosing. Pairs well with a Ginger Ale.</small></p>
</div>
  
<div class="detroit">
  <p>Detroit style pizza <span class="price">$8</span><br />
  <small>If you like messy, greasy pizza you will not go wrong with a Detroit pizza. This pizza has a homemade sauce thats drizzled all over the top and taste like no other.</small></p>
